### richsanchez' Exploit Mitigation Technologies Series

This series is absolutely fantastic as it covers the basics of how the simple exploit mitigation's came about, and some methods that have been developed to bypass them.  I'd highly recommend this series.[  
**Exploit Mitigation Techniques - Data Execution Prevention \(DEP\)**](https://0x00sec.org/t/exploit-mitigation-techniques-data-execution-prevention-dep/4634)**    
**[**Exploit Mitigation Techniques - Stack Canaries**](https://0x00sec.org/t/exploit-mitigation-techniques-stack-canaries/5085)**

Nothing major in this publication but goes through finding interesting gadgets within a binary that wouldn't normally be picked up by classic tools.
