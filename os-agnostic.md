# General Applications

This section details exploits, vulnerabilities and general enumeration techniques that can be found on any OS version, such as in the case of language interpreters.  This technically would encompass web-vulnerabilities but since that topic is so broad it has been given it's own section.

I will attempt to be as broad as possible, but in some cases it may be necessary to give examples only for a single operating system.
