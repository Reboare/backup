# Oracle Databases

Most of the examples here will be utilizing [ODAT ](https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat), the Oracle Database Attacking Tool.  This is because it has a number of exploits and scanners built in, is generally easier to set up and more stable than metasploit, and can use a lot of metasploits wordlists and data.  In general I'd recommend this over trying to get Metasploit up and running.

If however you are still keen then follow [this guide](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/How-to-get-Oracle-Support-working-with-Kali-Linux).  [Andy Gill's guide](https://blog.zsec.uk/msforacle/) also acts as an alternative resource.
